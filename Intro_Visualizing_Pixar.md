# Project-Visualizing-Pixar-Roller-Coaster

## Project Intro
Pixar Animation Studio, or simply Pixar, is one of the most well known animation studios in the world and many people worldwide religiously watch every new released film. Pixar released its first feature film, Toy Story, in 1995 and continued making quality and popular films afterwards including Finding Nemo, Monster's Inc, A Bug's Life and etc. To date, Pixar has released 16 movies in total (as in Feb, 2016). Pixar's movies are adored by kids for their charming characters and by adults for their wit. While Pixar has seen a lot of success, including a successful acquisition by Disney, not every one of their movies have been a hit. There are 15 movies included in this data set, missing the newest release of "The Good Dinosaur". I will explore through the data to generate some insights and visualizations.
